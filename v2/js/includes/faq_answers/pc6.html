<p>How your credit is affected by resolving debts will depend on many factors.  The good news is that after your accounts are resolved, we can then shift our representation of you over to the Credit Bureaus to address negative items on your credit report through our <strong> Credit Correction Legal Service</strong>. </p>
<p>If you currently have perfect, good, or even fair credit, Debt Resolution will derogatorily affect your credit. Do not let any fast talking so called "debt consultant" tell you that it will only hurt your credit while you are working on resolving your debt. This is not true.</p>
<p>If you currently have poor credit or already have accounts that are severely past due, it may not affect your credit any more negatively than it already is. Certainly the worse your credit is at the time you retain our firm, the less resolving your debts will adversely affect it. Any activity you have on your credit report, good or bad, is on there for 7 years.</p>
<p>We are always honest with our clients. For most individuals, Debt Resolution does negatively affect their credit score. Many clients that decide to move forward with our Firm to resolve their debts are willing to accept that their credit will be negatively affected. This is because they urgently need to do something about their problem debt. Also, these clients know we will continue to be there for them at the end of the resolution process, when we can address the negative items on their report through Credit Correction.</p>
<p>If these next statements are true, then Debt Resolution or settlement may not be the right course for you:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Good credit is important to you right now. </li>
    <li>You have the means to pay off your debt in full by making required monthly minimum payments.</li>
    <li>You can afford the high interest charges associated with paying off unsecured debt and can make the required minimum payments each month.</li>
</ol>
<p>While Debt Resolution will adversely affect your credit score, there are many factors that influence your overall credit. In addition to your credit FICO score (a number between 350 and 900) another major factor in determining your credit worthiness is your debt to income ratio. If you are maxed out on your credit lines and your debt to income ratio is out of sight, you are most likely not bankable, therefore, in many cases, even having a great credit score is not as valuable as it may seem.  Our knowledgeable staff can review your credit report with you to review your case in more detail. </p>
