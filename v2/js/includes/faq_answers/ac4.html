<p>Debts are usually resolved one at a time, as funds are available. As most clients are with us for 1-5 years, there is no way to predict exactly when certain accounts will be resolved. Your Attorney and legal team will strategize throughout the course of representation to determine the best way to manage the resolution of your accounts. The timing of resolutions are dependent upon a variety of factors such as: availability of funds, Attorney strategy, mix of creditors, state and federal laws, delinquency of accounts, who is collecting on the account, if there is active litigation, the time of year, creditor policy changes, etc.</p>
<p>Having patience throughout the process is key. It does take time and money to resolve accounts. Your debt did not happen overnight; resolving it will take time and we will be here to help you every step of the way.</p>
