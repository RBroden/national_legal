<p>Within the scope of Credit Correction Legal Service, our Attorneys will represent you to the Credit Bureaus to protect and assert your rights under various consumer protection laws.  The goal is to ensure that items on your credit report are 100% accurate and 100% verifiable. Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it is your right to request verification of items on your report that you feel may be inaccurate, misleading, incomplete, or unverifiable.  If the disputed item is not verified, it must be removed from your report.  It is common that disputed items cannot be verified because the creditor no longer has the information or does not want to go to the trouble of verifying it.  This is beneficial to you because, as a result of negative items being deleted from your report, you may see positive changes in your credit file.</p>
