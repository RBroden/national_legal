<h2>“Strategies for Success” Sessions<br>
Reinforcing your Blueprint for Winning Strategies</h2>

<p><b><u>Initial Attorney Consultation:</u></b><br>
When you call Client Support, one of our friendly Client Support Specialist will schedule your  initial consultation with your assigned Attorney.  During your consultation, the Attorney will  evaluate your case for conditional approval. The consultation will include a review of your  Asset Management form as well as a review of your Hardship Letters.  Your Attorney may  make recommendations to your Creditor Hardship, if any. The Attorney will address any  questions or concerns you may have and will evaluate all aspects of your case. Upon  completion of your consultation, the Attorney will “recommend” your case to proceed with  service,  subject to a final review by the Compliance Committee.  In that your Attorney is  reviewing your case after your assessment and recommendation by your Debt Analyst, you  can feel confident that your Attorney will be pleased to assist.</p>  <p>Throughout your term of service, your Attorney will oversee your case and will be available by  appointment should you have any legal questions or should an elevated matter arise.  Your  Attorney will work closely with your Case Manager to periodically assess your case.  Your  Attorney will also review all settlement offers.  Once a settlement is reached and a settlement  letter is secured, your Attorney will review the settlement letter to ensure the letter is legally  sufficient. You can always feel confident knowing your case is continually being monitored by  your Attorney as well as your entire Professional team.</p>  

<p><b><u>Client Manager Welcome Call and Consultation:</u></b><br>
Your assigned Client Manager is eager to meet you!  During your consultation, your Case  Manager will review your list of creditors and your payment schedule.  He or she will also  answer any additional questions you may have.  Based on your Attorney’s  recommendation and your Case Manager recommendation, as well as a review of the  Compliance Committees’ review, in most cases, your Case Manager will provide you with  your final approval during your consultation. In some case, a support representative will  contact you to discuss final Approval.</p> <p>Under the supervision of your Attorney, your Case Manager will implement various  strategies and will be your liaison between you and your creditors. Your Case Manager will   continually review your file and with your Attorney’s approval, initiate an Attorney  Representation Letter to each collection firm or creditor, when timing is appropriate.  Although your Case Manager is your primary contact, you have a full dedicated support  team at your service to assist you with any matter you need assistance with.   We’re here to help you!</p>

<p><b><u>In Person Closing:</u></b><br>
Should your Attorney be conveniently located near you and travel permissible, your closing  may take place together with your initial attorney consultation. If your Attorney is not  conveniently located near you, you will meet with one of our professional Local  Representatives for your official closing. Please be certain to review the agreement  downloaded in Step 1 prior to your closing and being them with you if you are meeting in a  location outside of your home. Also, please provide the following item to your  representative, if not already provided to us.<br>
