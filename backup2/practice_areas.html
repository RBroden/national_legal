        <h2>Debt Resolution Legal Service</h2>
        <p>If you owe over $10,000 in unsecured debt and are struggling with payments, our Debt Resolution Legal Service may be your best course of action to resolve your debt.  Our Attorneys and Professional staff will assist you in resolving your debts on a plan that will fit your personal situation and budget.  </p>
        <p>Once you are a client of National Legal Center, using our Debt Resolution Legal Service, you will be set up with an affordable monthly payment based on how much debt you owe, your budget and your personal goals.  Each month, your payment will be drafted from your personal bank account and be deposited in your Dedicated Account where all of your funds will be held under your name and social security for the purpose of settlement savings and disbursements.  A portion of your payment is allocated towards the Firm’s fee and the rest is allocated toward your savings for your settlements.   Your savings will accumulate each month, so that in time, lump sum funds become available to offer settlements to your creditors.  </p>
        <p>Each client's situation is different and the negotiation process will begin at different times depending on the amount of your debt, the particular creditors you owe and when funds become available in your resolution account. Once a favorable settlement is reached that you approve, we will instruct the creditor to send us the settlement offer in writing. Once an account is settled, the cycle continues as we move through each debt, until all of your debts have been settled.</p> 
 
<h2>FDCPA Enforcement </h2>
        <p>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which is often referred to as the FDCPA, was created by Congress in 1977 in response to the abusive conduct often engaged in by collection agencies.  The FDCPA is in place to protect you, the consumer, against the illegal tactics of the third party creditors.
 Our firm has a strong understanding of and experience with the debt collection laws under the FDCPA. If  you feel you have experienced a third party debt collector that has crossed the line by saying something or  doing something that makes you feel you are in violation of your civil rights, National Legal Center may  be able to help. 
</p>
        <p>• Has a collector used profanities when speaking to you? </p>
        <p>• Has a collector verbally abused you or threatened to physically harm you?</p>
        <p> • Has a collector disclosed personal, confidential information to a family member, friend or co-worker without your permissions?</p>
        <p> • Has a collector ever threatened to put you in jail?</p>
        <p> • Is a collector calling you at work, even though you have asked them to stop? </p> 
 
<p>These are all common violations of the FDCPA.  If they you are experiencing situations like the ones outlined above, contact our office for a free consultation.  We will always be honest and fair with you. Our representation may include educating you as to your rights under the Act and/or taking legal action against a debt collector that violates your rights under the FDCPA.
